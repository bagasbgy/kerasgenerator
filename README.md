The package is in early development stage and currently only available
via GitHub. You can install the development version using this way:

```

## Further Development

  - Support for generating data from **file in specified path**
  - Support for incorporating
    [`recipes`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/) package for
    **data preprocessing**
  - Data generator for **k-shot learning** model fitting
